## Background
XYZ Retail, a mid-sized retail chain specializing in apparel, electronics, and household items, struggled with optimizing sales performance and understanding customer preferences. The company relied on traditional sales reports, but they lacked real-time analytics, leading to:
🔹 Limited visibility into sales performance across stores and online channels.
🔹 Poor customer insights, making it difficult to personalize marketing efforts.
🔹 Inefficient inventory management, resulting in frequent stockouts and overstocking.
🔹 Missed revenue opportunities due to a lack of data-driven decision-making

## Key Components
🔹 Sales Performance Tracking – Analyzes revenue, profit margins, and store-wise performance.
🔹 Customer Insights & Segmentation – Identifies purchase behavior, demographics, and trends.
🔹 Inventory & Stock Management – Optimizes stock levels to prevent overstocking and stockouts.
🔹 Marketing Effectiveness – Tracks the impact of promotions, discounts, and campaigns.
The primary objective was to enhance decision-making with real-time insights, leading to improved sales and customer satisfaction.
